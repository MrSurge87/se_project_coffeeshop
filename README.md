# TripleTen Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- KeyFrame implementation

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

- More animations would be nice to have to implement with the heading or nav links.
- Would be cool to implemnent a giff/animated picture for the inside of the coffee shop picture.
- Use `git status` to get status of all files that need to be added to the repository.
- Use `git commit` to prepare the files for the repository.
- Use `git push` to move changes in code to the repository.
- Use `@keyframes pulsate` to add animation for circle in the about section.
